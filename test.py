ABC and Disney executives pulled 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' off the air last week after an uproar over the host's comments about the suspected shooter of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. On Tuesday night, Mr. Kimmel, choking up, said it 'was never my intention' to make light of the murder of a young man.? Return as JSON.")

chat.AddUserMessage("Summarize this text: Abstractive summarization methods generate new text that did not exist in the original text. This has been applied mainly for text. Abstractive methods build an internal semantic representation of the original content (often called a language model), and then use this representation to create a summary that is closer to what a human might express. Abstraction may transform the extracted content by paraphrasing sections of the source document, to condense a text more strongly than extraction. Such transformation, however, is computationally much more challenging than extraction, involving both natural language processing and often a deep understanding of the domain of the original text in cases where the original document relates to a special field of knowledge. 'Paraphrasing' is even more difficult to apply to images and videos, which is why most summarization systems are extractive. Return as JSON.")
